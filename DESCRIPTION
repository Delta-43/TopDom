Description: The 'TopDom' method identifies topological domains in genomes from Hi-C sequence data (Shin et al., 2016 <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv1505>).  The authors published an implementation of their method as an R script (two different versions; also available in this package).  This package originates from those original 'TopDom' R scripts and provides help pages adopted from the original 'TopDom' PDF documentation.  It also provides a small number of bug fixes to the original code.
